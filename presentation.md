* Software tool to develop and maintain code
* Coding language agnostic
* Individuals or teams
* Public or private code

<!--
Presentation Notes:
 * Many software options exist (GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, SourceForge)
 * Can mix different document types together
 * Works well for small teams like FRC, or huge teams
 * Public code can be licensed as open source for others to use, distribute, modify
